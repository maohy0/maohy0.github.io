**LabVIEW** is a graphical programming tool for data acquisition and system control, widely used in engineering and science. **myDAQ**, a compact data acquisition device, pairs seamlessly with LabVIEW for real-time experiments and prototyping. Together, they offer an accessible solution for learning and development in fields like electrical engineering and physics.

There are some tiny projects we finished during the Summer School at [HIT](http://en.hit.edu.cn). In this blog, I shall introduce them one by one.

0 Installing LabVIEW
------

In this project, we used LabVIEW 2015. The resources could be easily found on Internet.

1 Basic Operation of myDAQ
------

1. First, we need to connect myDAQ to our PC using a USB cable. If the connection set up, the blue LED on USB port of myDAQ will turn on.
2. Then we run NI Measurement & Automation Explorer (hereinafter - MAX)
