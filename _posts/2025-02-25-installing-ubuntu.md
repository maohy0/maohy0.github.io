Now the installation of Ubuntu could be pretty easy. It's okay to follow the [tutorial provided by Canonical](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview). There are something I encountered when I install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for a Lenovo ThinkPad Edge E430c.

* For users in Mainland China, downloading Ubuntu image from [ubuntu.com](https://ubuntu.com) may be slow, so we could download from mirrors, such as [this](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn).
