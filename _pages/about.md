Hello everyone! Nice to meet you here! My name is 毛宏宇 (Mao Hongyu), and I am currently a junior student at Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai, majoring in Communication Engineering. For more details, you could have a look at my [CV](/cv/) if you are interested.

I am now updating [Blog Posts](/posts/) and [previous project code](https://github.com/maohy0) gradually. In addition, some blogs in Chinese will be updated on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/93-29-65-23-34). Updates might be slow because of my filled timetable for courses.

At last, for collaborations, questions, or just a chat, feel free to drop me an [Email](mailto:m3747hongyu@qq.com). Thanks for stopping by - your visit means a lot! And by the way, good luck to all of you! ヾ(≧▽≦*)o
